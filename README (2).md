# Decentralized run-to-earn platform (Mobile app). E.run

## Objective

To develop a decentralized platform that incentivizes users to engage in physical activities,
such as running, by earning cryptocurrency or rewards. The platform integrates GPS
tracking and accelerometer data from mobile devices to monitor user activity and reward
them for staying active.**

## Motivation

* Encourage physical fitness by providing a financial incentive for users to stay active.
* Utilize blockchain technology for transparency and fairness in reward distribution.

* Foster a community around health and fitness with gamified experiences.

## Core Features

1. **Activity Tracking via GPS and Accelerometer:** Tracks user movement and
   distance in real-time using GPS and phone sensors to reward activity
2. **Smart Contracts for Reward Distribution:** Automatically distributes rewards
   (tokens/crypto) to users based on their physical activity without intermediaries.
3. **Health Analytics:** Provides users with insights like calories burned, distance
   covered, and fitness improvements over time

## Demo

1. Login via Email, so in the app you put your email, hit login button, we using Magic Link, so it sends link to your email to confirm email address, that link directs you back to the app and you in the app. Once after signing you don't need to type your email again to reopen the app.
2. There is 2 main pages: Run and Activity, in the Run section you can track your activity via GPS, it measures your distance and pace in the real time, and activity time, and in the Activity section you can see your recent runs.
3. As a backend and database system, we used Supabase, alternative to Firebase.
